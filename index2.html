            Boston Dynamics is an engineering company specializing in robotics.
            It is known for developing a four-legged robot for military
            purposes. Previously, the company worked on replacing training
            videos with an interactive computer simulator.
          </h3>

          <h3 class="text_bd2">
            The path of Boston Dynamics robots to the consumer was a long one:
            cooperation with the US military and a bad experience with Google.

          How did a company that grew out of a university lab end up under the
          wing of legendary investor Masayoshi Son decades later, and how far
          does it still have to go to our homes?

        <h3 class="answer_text">
          The president and key figure of the company is Mark Raibert, who
          created it in 1992 on the basis of a group of engineers at the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="yt_text">
          Demonstration videos of the robot manufacturer Boston Dynamics from
          Massachusetts with its two-legged and four-legged creatures collect
          millions of views on YouTube, and skeptics are increasingly afraid of
          the rise of machines, sometimes even drawing parallels with the
          dystopian TV series "Black Mirror".

        /></a>
        <h3 class="frst_rbt">
          In 1992, scientific research within the walls of the laboratory gets
          an organizational embodiment – Raibert creates the company Boston
          Dynamics. Next year, the company, whose robots will become almost
          pop-cultural characters in the noughties, will take the first steps in
          this direction. In the movie" The Rising Sun " with Sean Connery and
          Wesley Snipes, two Boston Dynamics robots, a three-dimensional robot
          on two legs 3D Biped and Uniroo, had cameos.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="txt">
          Meanwhile, Raibert and his wards were creating more and more robots.
          In 1994, there was a robot turkey, in 1996-a robot flamingo.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="txt2">
          Despite the creation of the company, Raibert did not commercialize his
          developments, but continued to work for the government, or rather for
          the Pentagon. However, without selling robots, Boston Dynamics advised
          those who did it. For example, the company advised Sony on the
          creation of consumer robots, in particular the Aibo robot.
        </h3>
        <h3 class="txt3_b_d">
          However, a truly well-known company, Boston Dynamics, made another
          project, albeit also related to"dogs". The company started to engage
          in this project in 2003, together with the NASA Jet Propulsion
          Laboratory, Harvard University and the British robot manufacturer
          Foster-Miller. The very first robot to become widely known was the
          BigDog, a four-legged mule designed to transport goods. The US
          Department of Defense needed a vehicle capable of traveling over rough
          terrain and carrying heavy equipment. The first BigDog models were
          created in 2005 and had the following technical characteristics:
          height 0.76 m, length 0.91 m, weight 110 kg, carried load up to 155
          kg, travel speed 5-7 km / h, the ability to overcome slopes up to 35
          °, as well as the ability to get up and down after a fall.

          Another high-profile development of Boston Dynamics of those years — a
          fleet-footed robot Cheetah ("cheetah"), which on the treadmill
          developed a speed of 29 miles per hour (46.6 km/h) — faster than Usain
          Bolt. Boston Dynamics was not limited to quadrupeds. Under a contract
          with DARPA, the company was developing a two-legged robot called Atlas
          to compete in a robot competition run by the Pentagon. The purpose of
          the competition is to create a class of robots that can work in the
          conditions of natural and man-made disasters.
